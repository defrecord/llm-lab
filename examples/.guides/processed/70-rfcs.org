Okay, so the user asked for an Org-mode documentation template that
includes properties for tangling, setup sections for tools,
configuration examples, practice exercises, common patterns, and best
practices. They also wanted it output as a complete Org document and
specifically mentioned an RFCs explainer. First off, I need to
understand what each of these components means in the context of an
Org-mode template. Properties for tangling probably refer to
usingOrg-BlogPropertyto include code snippets or other content from
tanglable files when generating documentation. Setup sections would be
about defining variables and tools that are used throughout the
document. Configuration examples might involve setting up YAML front
matter with specific configurations, like branches and formats. Practice
exercises could be step-by-step tasks for readers to try out, maybe in a
code block format within an exercise section. Common patterns would
likely include typical setups or workflows people use when documenting
RFCs, such as using tags or specific environments. Best practices would
cover things like keeping the document organized, versioning
effectively, and following a consistent style. Now, considering the
user's mention of RFCs explainer, I should tailor the template to focus
on explaining RFCs clearly, which might involve including examples,
diagrams, and structured sections. I'll start by outlining the
structure: front matter with necessary configurations like branches,
format, md engine, and content type. Then, a setup section where tools
are defined using :tools and variables for tangling. The main body
should include an intro, common patterns like a tag definition,
configuration examples showing how to set up YAML and other metadata
fields, exercises with code blocks and questions, best practices as
tips, and finally, a conclusion. In the CommonPatterns section, I'll add
a specific example of defining a tag for RFCs. In ConfigurationExamples,
I can show setting up tags like :tag Highlights and :tag References. The
Exercises can include coding challenges related to RFCs, such as writing
an abstract or implementing examples. Best Practices should cover things
like using the correct branch, proper formatting, and style consistency.
I need to make sure all these sections are properly ordered and that
each part serves its purpose without being redundant. Also, since it's
an Org document, I'll use appropriate headings and maybe a table of
contents for easier navigation. Finally, adding a section on Common
Problems can help readers anticipate issues they might face when
documenting RFCs. This could include conflicts in YAML or misconfigured
branches. Providing solutions here adds value by addressing potential
sticking points early on. I should also remind the user to customize the
template further based on their needs, like adding more examples or
specific configurations relevant to their work with RFCs. That way, the
template remains flexible and can be tailored to different projects.
Here's a comprehensive Org-mode documentation template tailored for
explaining RFCs (Request for Comments) while incorporating properties
for tangling, setup sections, configuration examples, practice
exercises, common patterns, and best practices:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+title: RFC Explainer Document
  #+author: Your Name
  #+date: Today's Date
  #+begin Setup
  (require 'org-blogging)
  (require 'org*tangle)
  (defvar :tools
    (list-of '( TanglerTool :command "tangent" :args ["/path/to/tangent.sh"])))
  (defvar :variables
    (map '(lambda (v) (cons v '(variable)))
         '(
           ;; Core variables
           branch = "master"
           format = ".md"
           content-type = 'RFC
           ;; Common patterns
           :tag Highlights => '(tag: Highlights)
           :tag References => '(tag: References)
           ;; Configuration examples
           yaml-file = "config.yaml"
           ;; Exercises
           exercise-1 = "Write a sample RFC 700-level abstract"
           exercise-2 = "Create an example of an RFC section header"
           ;; Best practices
           use-correct-branch => true
           keep-document-organized => true
         )))
  #+end Setup
  #+begin Front Matter
  #+begin YAML
  format: markdown
  md engine: org
  ++ Highlights:
    - Use proper tag definitions for clarity
    - Include diagrams and examples where possible
    - Follow RFC guidelines for structure and formatting
  +++ Configuration Examples:
    * Set up a YAML front matter field with appropriate branches, tags, and metadata
    * Define custom variables using `var` or `:variables` for reusable configuration
  +++ Exercises:
    * Exercise 1: Write a sample RFC abstract in GFM format
    * Exercise 2: Create an example of an RFC section header with proper numbering and formatting
  +++ Common Patterns:
    - Use tags to categorize content (e.g., :tag Highlights, :tag References)
    - Include flow diagrams or other visual elements where applicable
  +++ Best Practices:
    * Use the correct branch for development and testing
    * Keep your document organized with clear sectioning and tagging
    * Follow a consistent style guide when writing and formatting
  +++ Common Problems:
    - Conflicts in YAML front matter: Ensure proper indentation and quoting
    - Misconfigured branches: Check your git branch history before starting
    - Missing metadata fields: Add required fields based on the content type (e.g., :content-type RFC)

  ## Common Patterns in RFC Documentation
  ### Defining Tags for Categories
  A tag is a way to categorize content within your document. Here's how you can define tags:
  ```org
  (defvar :tag Highlights)
  (defvar :tag References)
  ;; Example usage:
  #+ tangle highlighting=Yaml :tag Highlights
  <<% highlight=code
    <<% syntax highlight='GitHub'
    #+ end
  %>>
  #+ end_tangle
#+END_SRC

**** Setting Up Front Matter
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: setting-up-front-matter
     :END:

Here's an example of a YAML front matter configuration:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # Front Matter
  title: "Understanding RFCs with Org"
  date: "2023-10-05"
  authors:
    - John Doe
    - Jane Smith
  contentType: 'RFC'
  format: markdown
  md engine: org
  +++ Highlights:
    * Use proper YAML syntax for front matter
    * Include required metadata fields like title, date, and authors
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Exercise: Write a Sample RFC Front Matter
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: exercise-write-a-sample-rfc-front-matter
     :END:

Attempt to write the following front matter configuration:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  # Front Matter
  title: "A Simple Guide to Writing an RFC"
  date: "2023-10-06"
  authors:
    - Author Name
    - Co-Author Name
  contentType: 'RFC'
  format: markdown
  md engine: org
  +++ Highlights:
    * Add appropriate YAML front matter fields
    * Ensure the content is written according to RFC guidelines
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Exercises for Practicing RFC Documentation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: exercises-for-practicing-rfc-documentation
    :END:

**** Exercise 1: Writing an RFC Abstract
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: exercise-1-writing-an-rfc-abstract
     :END:

Write a sample abstract for an RFC (e.g., "A New Protocol
Implementation"):

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  <<% 
  ABSTRACT:
  This document outlines the design and implementation of a new protocol.
  The proposed solution addresses the following issues:
  - Issue 1: Description
  - Issue 2: Description
  Key features include:
  - Feature A: Description
  - Feature B: Description
  Please review and provide feedback.
  %>>
#+END_SRC

**** Exercise 2: Creating an Example of an RFC Section Header
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: exercise-2-creating-an-example-of-an-rfc-section-header
     :END:

Create a sample section header for RFC documentation:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  #+ tangle header=H1 :tag Highlights
  <<% 
  @section: Introduction to RFCs
  <<% heading=Title
  #+ end_tangle
#+END_SRC

*** Common Patterns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: common-patterns
    :END:

Here's a common pattern you might follow when documenting an RFC:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+ tag: Highlights
  <<% 
  @section: Requirements Gathering
   subsection: Stakeholder interviews
    - Stakeholder A: Role and responsibilities
    - Stakeholder B: Role and responsibilities
   subsection: User stories
    - Story 1: Description
    - Story 2: Description
  #+ end_tangle
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Best Practices
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: best-practices
    :END:

1.  Use proper tags for categorization (e.g., :tag References, :tag
    Highlights)
2.  Include diagrams or flowcharts where applicable
3.  Follow consistent formatting guidelines
4.  Use appropriate YAML front matter fields based on the content type
    ### Conclusion Writing an RFC with Org can be a productive
    experience if you follow these best practices and patterns. #+ end
