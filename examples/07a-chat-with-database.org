* Chat With Your Database Demo

This example demonstrates how to use LLM tools to create a natural language interface to a SQLite database. It leverages the new tool support in LLM 0.26a0, as discussed in Simon Willison's [[https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html#tools][PyCon 2025 workshop]] and [[https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/14/llm-adds-support-for-tools/][blog post]].

** 1. Introduction

LLM 0.26a0 adds support for tools - specialized functions that the model can use to perform specific tasks. In this example, we'll create a tool that allows the LLM to execute SQL queries against a database and then interpret the results.

This enables us to build a natural language interface where users can ask questions about data in plain English, and the LLM will:
1. Translate the question into SQL
2. Execute the SQL query
3. Interpret the results in a user-friendly way

** 2. Core Implementation

First, let's create our chat with database script that implements the ~execute_sql()~ tool:

#+begin_src python :tangle ../examples/chat_with_database.py
#!/usr/bin/env python
"""
Chat with your database example - demo for LLM 0.26a0 tools feature
Based on Simon Willison's PyCon 2025 workshop materials

This script creates a simple chat interface where users can ask questions about a database
in natural language. It uses an LLM to translate those questions into SQL queries and 
then executes them against a SQLite database.

** 3. How It Works

The key components of this example are:

*** The ~execute_sql()~ Tool
The core of this implementation is the ~execute_sql()~ tool function:

#+begin_src python :eval no
def execute_sql(sql: str):
    """
    Tool for the LLM: run arbitrary SQL against the SQLite DB
    and return the rows as a list of dicts.
    """
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
        conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        cursor.execute(sql)
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
        
        # Convert rows to list of dicts
        result = [dict(row) for row in rows]
        
        conn.close()
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
#+end_src

This function:
1. Takes a SQL query string as input
2. Connects to the SQLite database
3. Executes the query
4. Returns the results as a list of dictionaries
5. Handles errors gracefully

*** The LLM Chain
We integrate the tool with the LLM using the ~model.chain()~ method:

#+begin_src python :eval no
response = model.chain(
    user_input,
    system=system_prompt,
    tools=[execute_sql],
    reasoning_effort="high"
)
#+end_src

This connects the user's natural language question to our SQL execution tool.

*** The System Prompt
The system prompt provides critical context to the LLM:

#+begin_src text :eval no
You are a helpful assistant that helps users query a SQLite database.

The database has the following schema:

{schema}

When users ask questions about the data, you should:
1. Translate their question into a SQL query
2. Use the execute_sql tool to run that query
3. Explain the results in a helpful way

If the query fails, explain why and suggest a corrected query.
Always show the SQL you're executing to the user.
#+end_src

This prompt:
1. Informs the LLM about the database schema
2. Provides clear instructions on how to process user questions
3. Sets expectations for error handling and explanation

** 4. Running the Example

To run this example:

#+begin_src shell :eval no
# Make sure your environment is set up
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the script
uv run python examples/chat_with_database.py
#+end_src

** 5. Example Interaction

Here's a sample conversation with the database:

#+begin_example
Welcome to the database chat interface!
Ask questions about the customers and orders in the database.
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the session.

Your question: How many customers do we have?

Thinking...

I'll run a query to count the number of customers in the database.

SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as customer_count FROM customers;

Result: There are 4 customers in the database.

Your question: What's the total amount spent by each customer?

Thinking...

I'll run a query to calculate the total amount spent by each customer.

SQL:
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

Results:
Alice Smith has spent the most at $2,225.97 in total.
Charlie Brown has spent $349.99.
Diana Prince has spent $159.99.
Bob Jones has spent $89.99.

Your question: Who bought a laptop?

Thinking...

I'll search for customers who purchased a laptop.

SQL: 
SELECT c.name, o.product, o.amount, o.order_date 
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.product = 'Laptop';

Result:
Alice Smith purchased a Laptop for $1,299.99 on 2024-01-20.
#+end_example

** 6. Customization Ideas

Here are some ways you could extend this example:

- Connect to other database engines like PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Add additional tools for more capabilities (e.g., data visualization)
- Enhance the system prompt for more specialized querying behaviors
- Store conversation history to build context over time
- Add authentication for secure database access
